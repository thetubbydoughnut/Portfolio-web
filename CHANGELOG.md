## 2025-05-12 - Code Review and Error Investigation

- **Fixed**: Added missing dependencies (`framer-motion`, `react-intersection-observer`) to `package.json` and ran `npm install` to resolve import errors in `Certifications.jsx`.
- **Fixed**: Updated the import path for `bloomtech-certificate-preview.webp` in `src/pages/Certifications.jsx` to resolve an import error.
- **Investigated**: Looked into the `[vite:css] @import must precede all other statements` warning. The import in `src/styles/Contact.css` is correctly placed; the warning might be a build process nuance. The build currently completes successfully.
- **Investigated**: Examined the `THREE.Material: parameter 'vertexColors' has value of undefined` error originating from `Layout.jsx`. Confirmed that `vertexColors: false` is already correctly set in the Vanta NET configuration, aligning with Three.js best practices. The error might stem from the Vanta library itself or its internal Three.js interaction.
- **Next Steps**: Proceed with general codebase review, responsiveness enhancements, and test implementation. Monitor the `vertexColors` console error.
- **Fix:** Resolved certificate display issue on `Certifications`
