# Next Steps

1.  **Content:** Populate `HireMe.jsx` with specific content from your resume (`05-12-2025 Cameron Graham Full Stack Web Developer Resume.webp`).
2.  **Review:** Conduct a code review of recent changes (`Certifications.jsx`, `HireMe.jsx`, `App.jsx`, `Header.jsx`, related CSS) for quality and adherence to best practices.
3.  **SEO:** Review `index.html` meta tags again to ensure they align with the "Hire Me" focus and target relevant keywords.
4.  **`.gitignore`:** Check `.gitignore` file to ensure `node_modules`, `.env` (if used), and other unnecessary files/folders are excluded.
5.  **Resume Link:** Verify the resume download link (`/cameron-graham-resume.pdf`) on the `Hire Me` page works correctly (ensure the file is in the `public` directory).
6.  **Testing:** Test all navigation links, page rendering, certificate link, and resume download.
7.  **Console Errors:** Monitor the browser console for any persistent errors, especially the Vanta `vertexColors` warning, although it might be benign.

## Next Steps for Portfolio Website

Based on the recent review (2025-05-12), here are potential areas for improvement and further review:

1.  **Performance Optimization**: 
    *   Address the Vite build warning: `Some chunks are larger than 500 kB after minification.` Investigate code splitting (dynamic `import()`) or manual chunk configuration in `vite.config.js` to reduce initial load size, particularly for the large vendor chunk.
    *   Review image optimization. Ensure all images (like those in `src/assets/images` and `src/assets/Certs and resume`) are appropriately sized and compressed.
    *   Analyze network requests and component rendering performance using browser dev tools.

2.  **Code Quality & Best Practices**:
    *   **Environment Variables**: Consider moving other potentially configurable values (e.g., LinkedIn/Twitter URLs in `Header.jsx`, API endpoints if more are added) to `.env`.
    *   **Component Structure**: Review the purpose of having both `src/pages/Projects.jsx` and `src/components/Projects.jsx` (if the latter still exists and is used). Consolidate or clarify their roles if necessary.
    *   **CSS Structure**: Evaluate the organization of CSS. Consider CSS Modules, Styled Components, or Tailwind CSS for more maintainable and scoped styles, especially as the project grows.
    *   **Accessibility (a11y)**: Perform a more thorough accessibility audit using tools like Axe DevTools or Lighthouse to ensure compliance beyond basic checks.
    *   **TypeScript**: Consider migrating the project to TypeScript for better type safety and developer experience, especially if the project complexity increases.

3.  **Functionality & Content**:
    *   **Resume Format**: Re-evaluate using `.webp` for the resume download. Providing a standard PDF version in the `public/` directory would offer a more conventional user experience.
    *   **Error Handling**: Enhance error handling for API calls (e.g., GitHub API in `Projects.jsx`, EmailJS in `Contact.jsx`). Provide more user-friendly feedback on errors.
    *   **Contact Form**: Verify the EmailJS integration is fully functional and secure (using environment variables for keys).
    *   **Content Update**: Review all text content for clarity, grammar, and accuracy.

4.  **Documentation**:
    *   Expand `README.md` with more detailed setup instructions, environment variable explanations, and deployment steps.
    *   Add comments to complex logic sections (e.g., `getImpressionScore` in `Projects.jsx`).

5.  **Testing**:
    *   Implement unit or integration tests for key components or functions (e.g., `getImpressionScore`, API fetching logic) using a testing library like Vitest.
